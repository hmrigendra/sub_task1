Open source is the thing that fuels the world. Without open source people will have to spend a ton of money on various subsciptions they buy. Open source keeps a check on these companies which charge a lot of money and also give these wonderful softwares of no less standard to the people. I also use open souce because it is basically free and many open source softwares out there do the exact same thing as the paid versions. I want to contribute in open source for the same reason. I want ot help the people in the world by giving them alternatives to these expensive softwares and make life eays for them. Thank you.
I basically love open source
